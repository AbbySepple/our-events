# Our Events

Our Events stems from the issue of trying to plan gatherings around several ever changing schedules. Our Events allows users to register with their group name, user name, and password. Once logged in they can create events. Anyone within that group can then update any of the event details and a text message can be sent out notifying the other group members there has been a change.
